Nurse: Alright, Mrs. Johnson. Let's start with the albuterol inhaler. First, shake the inhaler well.
Patient: Like this? (sound of shaking)
Nurse: That's right. Now, take off the cap and hold the inhaler upright. Breathe out fully.
Patient: (exhales)
Nurse: Good. Now, put the mouthpiece in your mouth and close your lips around it. As you start to breathe in slowly, press down on the inhaler.
Patient: (inhales, then coughs) Oh dear, I'm not sure I did that right.
Family Member: It's okay, Mom. You can try again.
Nurse: That's alright, Mrs. Johnson. It takes a bit of practice. Let's try once more.
(Sound of inhaler being used)
Nurse: Much better! Now hold your breath for about 10 seconds, then breathe out slowly.
Patient: (exhales) Like that?
Nurse: Perfect. You'll want to do two puffs each time, waiting about a minute between puffs.
Family Member: Should she rinse her mouth after using it?
Nurse: Good question. For the albuterol, it's not necessary. But for the fluticasone inhaler, yes, she should rinse her mouth to prevent thrush.
Patient: Thrush? What's that?
Nurse: It's a kind of yeast infection in the mouth. Don't worry, rinsing will help prevent it.
(Beeping sound from a nearby machine)
Nurse: Now, let's go over the fluticasone inhaler. The technique is similar, but you'll use it twice a day, morning and evening.
Patient: (coughs) Twice a day, got it.
Nurse: Exactly. And remember to rinse after this one. Any questions about the inhalers?
Family Member: What about side effects?
Nurse: Good question. The albuterol might cause some jitteriness or a rapid heartbeat. The fluticasone could cause a sore throat or hoarseness. If you notice any severe side effects, contact us immediately.
Patient: This all seems so complicated...
Nurse: Don't worry, Mrs. Johnson. I'll write all this down for you. Now, let's head to radiology for your chest X-ray.
(Sounds of wheelchair being moved, people talking in hallway)
X-ray Technician: Mrs. Johnson? We're ready for you.
Patient: (coughs) Okay.
X-ray Technician: I'll need you to remove any metal objects and put on this gown. Your family member can help you if needed.
Family Member: I'll help her. Mom, let's get your necklace off.
(Rustling sounds)
X-ray Technician: Great. Now, Mrs. Johnson, I'll need you to stand against this board. Try to stay as still as possible.
Patient: I'll try, but I might cough.
X-ray Technician: That's okay. Just try your best to hold still when I say "don't breathe."
(Machine whirring)
X-ray Technician: Take a deep breath and hold it... Don't breathe...
(Machine clicks)
X-ray Technician: And relax. Great job. We'll need a few more images.
(Process repeats a couple more times)
X-ray Technician: All done. You can get dressed now, Mrs. Johnson.
Nurse: (returns) How did it go?
Patient: (coughing) It wasn't too bad. What's next?
Nurse: We'll do your blood draw now, then the spirometry test.
Family Member: How long will all this take?
Nurse: We should be done in about an hour. Then you can go home and rest while we wait for the results.
(Walking sounds, then a door opening)
Lab Technician: Mrs. Johnson? I'll be doing your blood draw. Can you confirm your date of birth for me?
Patient: It's July 15, 1955.
Lab Technician: Thank you. Please have a seat and roll up your sleeve.
(Sound of chair moving, rustling of clothes)
Lab Technician: You might feel a small pinch. Try to relax your arm.
Patient: (winces) Ouch.
Lab Technician: All done. Press this cotton ball on the site for a few minutes.
Nurse: Great job, Mrs. Johnson. Now, let's move on to the spirometry test. This will measure how well your lungs are working.
Patient: (sighs) Okay. What do I need to do?
Nurse: You'll breathe into a mouthpiece connected to the spirometer. I'll guide you through the process. First, let's go over the instructions...
(Conversation fades out)
